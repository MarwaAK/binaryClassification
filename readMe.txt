The objective of the project is to apply a Machine Learning models onto two diﬀerent datasets:
1.Chronic Kidney Disease: https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease 
2.Banknote Authentication Dataset: https://archive.ics. uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication


- Python functions implementing the workﬂow are written in function.py ﬁle;
- The workﬂow is applied onto the two datasets in the notebook Project_ML.ipynb.
